# Cade-Data-Entry-Pre-Release
Cade is a data entry application where the user can enter Tasks or things that they are grateful for. It was built with PyQtWidgets 6, Python 3.11, in Pycharm on Windows 11

## Project Overview
Here we are again. This is my third official Python project. The previous one I did was a finite state calculator using Python 3.11 and PyCharm, but that one used Tkinter as a UI. This one instead uses Qt, because I saw more versatility and it was a UI that I wanted to learn.
There was a prototype of this project where I fiddled around with things, but I came up with the idea of having a Task and Gratitude data entry program because that would be what would help me the most. There was also a section that was supposed to be dedicated to goals, which could be added prior to official release, but for now I’m keeping it as Task and Gratitude, mainly because I saw goals as being the same as a task.

## Purpose of the Project
I made this program to learn Qt widgets and to learn SQL. This project uses SQLite as a database, which was my second time using it, and it worked out well.
However, this project is a precursor to a larger project that I’m drawing up the scheme for. It’s in the early stages right now, and I have another mini-project that will be another precursor to this big project, and that should be my next repository.

## SDLC Participation and Testing
In addition to the development part of the SDLC, I’m also taking part in the testing phase, which means there is a test plan available for this project. It gives all the possible areas of testing and will be available in this repository, as well as all the test cases that will be done for it.
Only then will I release the CADE application.

## Why It’s Called CADE
I couldn’t think of a name for it. I went through a couple names because I wanted to make this app as official as possible, even though it’s a simple data entry app. I came up with CADE because when you're inputting information into this, like task 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on, it’s like a cascade that falls top to bottom. It reminded me of a waterfall, and cascade is a beautiful word. So I cut it short and named it CADE.

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to have the user be able to have data persistence after exit and upon initialization. That means that if I enter three tasks into the application, then when I reopen it, the tasks are still going to be there.

## Application Features
The features of this application include a simple Enter button that can also be accessed through pressing the Enter key. You can clear all entries in a tab, or you can clear a single entry. When you open the clear single entry window, there is a spin box that you can only put numbers in. The maximum number is the maximum number of entries that you have. If you have four tasks, you cannot go up to task five or task six. You cannot input a number higher than the total number of entries that you have in that list.
There are a bunch of pop-up windows as well. I figured out how to get the window sound in there. That is the extent of the application.

## Task and Gratitude Behavior
If you clear all entries, the text is set to either “no tasks set yet” or “no gratitude set yet.” Tasks and gratitude are numbered ordinarily. If I have three tasks, task one, two, and three, and I delete task two, then task three becomes task two. The tasks ordinality reorders itself.
